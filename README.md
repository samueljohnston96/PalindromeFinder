# PalindromeFinder
This program is a simple Palindrome finder.  It takes in as an input 2 numbers that are both integer size.  (If the numbers are too large the behavior is undefined)
The order of the numbers entered doesn't matter, just place one in each of the upper input fields.
If no number is entered in a field the program assumes it is a zero.
Once ready just press the "Search For Largest Palindrome" button and the result will display below the button in the Result Box field.
If the User enters in a non numeric input the program responds with a simple Error message and waits for the user to try to search again.
